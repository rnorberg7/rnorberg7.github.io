# CIT 281 Code Portfolio! :rocket:

In my CIT code portfolio it contains content form my project 2,3, and 4. The content within each project ranges from my first attempt at creating a project page displayed in my project 2 link. In the project 3 link it contains my ability to create a 500px app that allows the user to search any term and it will send back 20 images of a particular term, the project also displays a smaller flicker app as well that works similar to my 500px application. Finally we have my final project completed in CIT 281, within this project we were tasked with creating another app similar to my 500px, but we used the unsplash application instead. In the completion of this project we also designed a Youtube application that will allow the user to search any term and the app will then display back a video based on the specific term given.
